ComLine
=======
A tool to check command line parameters of called program.

It is relatively lightweight as it does not use VCL.

When is it needed
-----------------

Sometimes you might want to run some external executable files from your program, but the called EXE either does not run or runs not as planned and you suspect wrong command line parameters.

Also you might prove to programmers that their software isn't composing a right command line.

How to use
----------

Substitute a program to be called with this EXE. Make other software to call it. View command line parameters. Debug calling software. Check again. Restore the original EXE file.
